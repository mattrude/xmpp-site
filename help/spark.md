## Adding a Contact

What's chat without other people? It's a good way to attract unwanted attention! You're really off and running when you've got a contact list with a few other chatters in it. If you're working on a company network, it might be that your contact list is full before you even send your first message; your administrator can create lists you see. But you can also add other folks.

In particular, you can add people who chat using Spark or an application like it. That includes Jabber users, Google Talk users, and others. Those applications support the XMPP protocol; people often refer to this simply as the "Jabber" protocol because that was one of the first IM applications to use it.

1. Click the **Add** a contact button.
2. Enter your contact's information. In the **Add Contact** dialog, enter the contact's username. This will look like an email address. That's how XMPP — Jabber-style — user names work.
3. Select or enter the name of the group you want to add the contact to, then click **Add**.

If you decide you'd rather have the contact in another group, simply right-click their name, point to **Move to**, then click the name of the group you want to move them to.
