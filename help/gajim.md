## Overview

Gajim is a free software, instant messaging client for the Jabber (XMPP) protocol which uses the GTK+ toolkit. It runs on GNU/Linux, BSD and Windows. The name Gajim is a recursive acronym for Gajim (is) a jabber instant messenger.

The goal of Gajim is to provide a full featured and easy to use Jabber client. Gajim works nicely with GNOME, but does not require it to run. It is released under the GNU General Public License.

## Logging into Gajim for the first time

On the first time you start up Gajim the *Account Creation Wizard Dialog* will come up, which will guide you to either create a new account to connect to the jabber network or use an existing one, if you have.

So if this is your first time in the jabber network select the option for registering for a new account, choose one of the numerous jabber servers available that offers you the services you need and simply give a username and password. You are now connected!

You can always add a new account later at **Edit -> Accounts -> New**
